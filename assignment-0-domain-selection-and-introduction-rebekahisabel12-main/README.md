## Assignment 0<br><sup>Rebekah Dominguez</sup>

The problem domain that I want to explore concerns the analytical area of the research and development sector and involves the creation of a chromatography library software. The software would be able to streamline method development by offering a library of chromatography methods that researchers and students would be able to access via a search and retrieval mechanism. Currently many chromatography libraries are limited to libraries created by individual manufacturers of instruments and related products. This software would contain the potential to expedite projects that otherwise would require trial and error methods, saving time and resources. It also enhances reproducibility and can facilitate effective communication among analysts and researchers looking for support during troubleshooting or the development of complicated analytical methods. More than all these put together, it would create a centralized supportive network for professionals and students looking to enhance the field of analytical chromatography.

The domain of practice that this problem is situated in is within that of analytical chemistry and chromatography. Specifically, chromatography outside the realm of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS), both of which already have detailed libraries. The idea is for more research focused applications that might be developing a novel test method for a recently developed process. It would be more suited for diverse experimental scenarios focused on discovery rather than adhering to standardization, thus making it an ideal tool for researchers engaging in exploratory studies and specialized analyses. 

As fulltime research scientist, this software would personallly support my ability to efficiently conduct research and develop test methods. At the moment, my work involves extensive communication with instrument vendors and clients through calls and emails. However, this process is time-consuming as it takes days and sometimes weeks to gather sufficient information from the others to create an effective method for the process. While research papers can be valuable sources of information on analytical methods, they can be cumbersome, requiring extensive reading and following references before accessing the complete methodology. A centralized software to research chromatography methods would save time and resources for multiple analysts.

I would like to prototype a system with a user-friendly interface where analysts can easily input and store details about experiments and analytical methods involving chromatography. This would include details about instrument models, column specifications, method parameters and other related information. It would also contain a search and retrieval mechanism that will allow users to find relevant chromatography information based on specific criteria. 

To conclude the proposed chromatography library sofware addresses key challenges in analytical research and development through the use of a centralized repository of chromatography methods, streamlining development and community among researchers. Being in the domain of analytical chemistry, the software caters to diverse and novel experimental scenarios palcing an emphasis on exploration and discovery rather than standarization. As a research scientist, this system would significantly improve the efficiency of the research process and replace current time-consuming research methodolgies.
